# List of projects

- `calculator` : a very simple calculator made in React with TS.
- `bin2dec` : a binary to decimal convertor.
- `emoji-translator` : converts text into emoji. As of now it only works with a few example emojis but the list can be expanded or perhaps be linked to an emoji database.

- `todo` : a simple to-do list in TS.
